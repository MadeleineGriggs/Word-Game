## About this Project
this is a hangman style game, where you guess the letters of the name of a randomly selected pokemon. It was developed as part of the UofT coding bootcamp. It is written in plain Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This was my first major delve into javascript.
The game loads a randomly selected pokemon, and displays the number of letters in the pokemon name. It also takes an image of the pokemon, and blurs it out. The user guesses the pokemon name by using their keyboard to type the letters they would like to guess. If the user runs out of guesses before they get all the letters, the game reveals which pokemon it was, and unblurs the image, then adds to the losses counter and generates a new random pokemon. If the user guesses all the letters correctly the same thing happens, except it adds to the wins counter instead of the losses.
